Spiritual successor to [Basscss](https://basscss.com/), Masscss adopts all its classes (via [Ace.css](http://basscss.com/ace/)) and extends it with a gajillion more classes.

No Sass, no variables, no fancy build workflow - it's just raw CSS.   

To use, simply link to mass.css in your page and use any of the thousands of classes included.

To contribute, just add more classes.  Ie- start using this and whenever you find yourself reaching for a class that isn't already existing,  create it (following in the same declarative, functional, composable theme of the existing classes) and submit a PR. 

Props to [jxnblk](https://github.com/jxnblk) for making Basscss and other cool projects and to all his influencers too.
